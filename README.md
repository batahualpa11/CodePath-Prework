## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
- OBD Fusion
   - Works with apple carplay 
   - Reading vechicle information
   - Diagnostic reports
- LinkedIn
   - Pronouncing your name feature
   - Connections to potential job opportunities
   - New BETA "video" feature (similar to Tiktok)
- iBend Pipe or QuickBend
   - Press and slide to select measurement
   - Apple watch compatible
   - selection of bending tool feature
- Bluesky Social
   - Changing the background color of the messages screen
   - Deleting old messages
           - Improvements
                   - Add a bookmark feature
- Yogger: Movement Analysis App
   - Computer vision object tracking feature
   - Instant Biomechanical Data

## Potential App Idea
   - I'd like to create an app that allows users to monitor there progress with each session for any workout. It can track their biomechanical movements to help weightlifters, golf, soccer, and swimming athletes. In return allowing them to improve their technique. 

## Notes

- One notable problem I faced was when importing my work on my local computer to github using git.
